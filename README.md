# Getting started
You just only have to embed the css file in your html file like this:
```css
<link href="arabic-list.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
```

Then you can use the class `.arabic-list` in any unorderlist `<ul>` like following:
```css
<ul class = "arabic-list">
        <li>أحمد</li>
        <li>محمد</li>
        <li>خلدون</li>
</ul>
```
You can also use this code to define a new list type for yourprefered language.  For example; if you want to create new list type for persian language, you can edit `arabic-list.css` file to add persian charcaters in the order.

The following order is used for Arabic alphabets:
`أبجد هوز حطي كلمن سعفص قرشت ثخذ ضظغ`
